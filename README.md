# Squattr

Squattr is for entertainment purposes only. In no way are we offering legal advice or advising which properties to break into. Please obey all laws and avoid tresspassing charges.

Created as a group project for the UCLA Extension Web Development Coding Boot Camp. Because the Google Maps API charges money for every call to their database, we request that you do not make this app public or share on social media.

Created with Bootstrap and jQuery.

This application uses 4 APIs: LA City Data, Google Maps, Google Street View, and Firebase. We limited returned results to 100 for testing purposes, and to avoid overwhelming the user -but this cap can potentially be removed.

The data returned is from 2017 and therefore wildly out of date -which is perhaps for the best, as the app is for entertainment purposes only.
